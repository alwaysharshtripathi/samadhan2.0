## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB**: Make sure you have a running instance of MongoDB (either locally or on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/telegram-like-chat.git](https://github.com/your-username/telegram-like-chat.git)
    cd telegram-like-chat
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create an environment file from the example
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the required variables (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below).

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd ../frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**

    - **Start the backend server** (from the `/backend` directory):

      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

      The server will be running on the port you specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

    - **Start the frontend development server** (from the `/frontend` directory):
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
      The React app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

5.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to use the app!

## üîë Environment Variables

The backend requires the following environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory and add the following:

```env
# Server Port
PORT=8000

# MongoDB Connection URI
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/chatapp

# JWT Secret Key for signing tokens
